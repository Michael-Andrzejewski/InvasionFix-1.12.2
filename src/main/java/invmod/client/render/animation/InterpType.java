//  * Executive Summary:
//  * This code defines a package named invmod.client.render.animation, which is likely intended for use in a client-side rendering system, specifically for animations within a mod for a game or application. Within this package, an enumeration named InterpType is declared with a single enum constant, LINEAR.
//  *
//  * The InterpType enum is designed to represent different types of interpolation methods that can be used in animations. Interpolation is a technique used in animations to calculate intermediate frames between two keyframes to create the illusion of motion or transformation.
//  *
//  * Enum Constants:
//  * - LINEAR: This constant represents the linear interpolation type. Linear interpolation is the simplest form of interpolation, where the change between two values is consistent and evenly distributed over time. In the context of animations, this would mean that the animated property or object moves at a constant speed from one keyframe to the next.
//  *
//  * As the code currently contains only one interpolation type, it suggests that the system is either in an early stage of development or is designed for simplicity with only linear interpolation supported. Future enhancements may include adding more interpolation types to the InterpType enum to support more complex animation effects.
