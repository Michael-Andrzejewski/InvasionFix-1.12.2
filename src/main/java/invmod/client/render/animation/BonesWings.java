//  * Executive Summary:
//  * This code defines an enumeration within the 'invmod.client.render.animation' package, which is likely part of a larger system concerned with rendering and animating models in a client application, possibly a game or simulation software. The enumeration is named 'BonesWings' and it represents the key joints or points of articulation in a pair of wings, specifically for animation purposes.
//  *
//  * The 'BonesWings' enum contains four constants:
//  * - LEFT_SHOULDER: Represents the left shoulder joint of the wing.
//  * - RIGHT_SHOULDER: Represents the right shoulder joint of the wing.
//  * - LEFT_ELBOW: Represents the left elbow joint of the wing.
//  * - RIGHT_ELBOW: Represents the right elbow joint of the wing.
//  *
//  * Each of these constants can be used to reference specific bones in wing animations, allowing for a structured approach to animating wing movements. This could be particularly useful for developers working on the animation and rendering of characters or creatures with wings, providing a standardized set of bone references for consistent animation across different models.
