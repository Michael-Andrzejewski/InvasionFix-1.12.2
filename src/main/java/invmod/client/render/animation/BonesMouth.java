//  * This code defines an enumeration within the invmod.client.render.animation package, which is likely used for animation purposes within a client-side rendering system, possibly for a game or graphical application. The enumeration is named BonesMouth, which suggests that it is used to represent different parts of a mouth in an animation rig or model.
// 
//  * The BonesMouth enum has two constants:
//  * - UPPER_MOUTH: This likely represents the upper part of the mouth, which could be used to animate speaking, chewing, or facial expressions.
//  * - LOWER_MOUTH: This likely represents the lower part of the mouth, serving a similar purpose to the UPPER_MOUTH for animating the mouth's movements.
// 
//  * Overall, the BonesMouth enum is a simple data structure that provides a clear and limited set of options for referencing specific mouth bones in an animation system. It helps in maintaining consistency and readability in the code that deals with mouth animations.
