//  * This code defines an enumeration named IMEntityType within the invmod.nexus package. The purpose of this enumeration is to represent a list of constant entity types that are likely used within a mod or a game, possibly Minecraft or a similar game where such entities are common. Each constant in the enumeration represents a different type of entity that can be encountered or utilized within the game.
// 
//  * Enumeration Constants:
//  * - ZOMBIE: Represents a standard zombie entity.
//  * - ZOMBIEPIGMAN: Represents a zombie pigman entity, typically found in Nether-like environments.
//  * - SPIDER: Represents a spider entity.
//  * - SKELETON: Represents a skeleton entity, often equipped with a bow.
//  * - PIG_ENGINEER: Represents a pig engineer entity, which is not a standard Minecraft entity and suggests a custom modded entity.
//  * - THROWER: Represents an entity that can throw objects, likely a custom modded entity.
//  * - IMP: Represents an imp entity, suggesting a small, possibly mischievous creature, likely a custom modded entity.
//  * - PIG_ZOMBIE: Represents a pig zombie entity, similar to ZOMBIEPIGMAN but could have different attributes or behaviors.
//  * - BURROWER: Represents an entity that can burrow or dig through materials, indicating a custom modded entity with unique behavior.
//  * - CREEPER: Represents a creeper entity, known for its explosive characteristics when close to the player.
// 
//  * This enumeration is used to categorize and manage different entity types within the game's codebase, providing a standardized way of referencing these entities throughout the mod or game.
