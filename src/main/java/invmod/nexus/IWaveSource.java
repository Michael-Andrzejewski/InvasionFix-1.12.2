// /**
//  * Executive Documentation Summary:
//  * 
//  * The code defines a package named invmod.nexus and within this package, an abstract interface named IWaveSource is declared. The purpose of this interface is to establish a contract for classes that will implement it, ensuring that they provide a specific functionality related to "Wave" objects. This interface is likely part of a larger system concerned with managing waves, possibly in a game or simulation context where waves represent a series of challenges or events.
//  * 
//  * Interface: IWaveSource
//  * - Purpose: To provide a uniform method signature for retrieving a Wave object from implementing classes.
//  * - Usage: Classes that represent sources of waves will implement this interface to allow external entities to request the current wave.
//  * 
//  * Method: getWave()
//  * - Return Type: Wave
//  * - Access Level: Public Abstract
//  * - Description: This method is an abstract declaration with no implementation details. Implementing classes must provide their own specific logic to return an instance of a Wave. The Wave object returned could represent a single wave or a sequence of events that are to be processed or handled by the implementing system.
//  * 
//  * Note: The Wave class is not defined within this code snippet, and it is assumed to be part of the codebase where this interface will be implemented. The actual behavior and properties of the Wave class would significantly influence how the IWaveSource interface is implemented.
