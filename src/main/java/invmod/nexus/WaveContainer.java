//  * Executive Documentation Summary:
//  * 
//  * The WaveContainer class is part of the invmod.nexus package. Its primary purpose is to manage and store Wave objects, which are likely to represent individual waves in a simulation or game scenario involving invasions or attacks. The class is designed to be a container that can be expanded with additional functionality as needed.
//  * 
//  * Methods:
//  * - addWave(Wave wave): This method is intended to add a new Wave object to the WaveContainer. Currently, the method is empty and serves as a placeholder for future implementation. When fully implemented, it will handle the logic required to store Wave instances within the container, ensuring that they can be managed and accessed as part of the wave management system.
//  * 
//  * Note: As of the current state of the code, the WaveContainer class and its addWave method are not functional and require further implementation to be used effectively in an application.
