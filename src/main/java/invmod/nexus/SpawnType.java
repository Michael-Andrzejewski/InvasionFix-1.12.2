// /**
//  * Executive Summary:
//  * This code defines an enumeration within the 'invmod.nexus' package, named 'SpawnType'. The purpose of this enumeration is to categorize different types of spawnable entities within a game or application, specifically for a mod or a nexus where various creatures or characters may be generated. The 'SpawnType' enum provides a simple way to distinguish between various entity sizes and types, which can be used throughout the code to manage spawning logic, behaviors, or attributes associated with each type.
//  *
//  * Enumeration Details:
//  * - HUMANOID: Represents a standard humanoid entity, likely of a size and shape similar to a human.
//  * - LARGE_HUMANOID: Represents a larger version of a humanoid entity, possibly indicating stronger or more powerful characteristics.
//  * - GIANT: Signifies an entity of a significantly larger scale than humanoids, suggesting a formidable presence or strength.
//  * - SPIDER: Categorizes entities with arachnid-like features, which may affect their movement or the way they interact with the environment.
//  * - SMALL: Denotes smaller entities, which could imply weaker attributes or the need for different handling in the game mechanics.
//  * - WOLF: Specifies entities with characteristics of a wolf, potentially influencing their behavior patterns, pack dynamics, or role within the game.
//  *
//  * This enumeration can be expanded or modified to include additional spawn types as the needs of the application evolve.
