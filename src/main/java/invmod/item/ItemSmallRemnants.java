// /**
//  * Executive Summary:
//  * This code defines a custom item class for a Minecraft mod, named ItemSmallRemnants. The class extends the base Item class from Minecraft's net.minecraft.item package, allowing it to inherit the properties and behaviors of a standard item within the game.
//  *
//  * Class: ItemSmallRemnants
//  * - Purpose: To create a new item within the game that has specific properties such as a custom name, maximum stack size, and no damage value.
//  * - Extends: net.minecraft.item.Item
//  *
//  * Constructor: ItemSmallRemnants()
//  * - Initializes the item with predefined settings.
//  * - Sets the maximum damage of the item to 0, indicating that it does not take damage or degrade over time.
//  * - Sets the maximum stack size to 64, allowing players to stack up to 64 of these items in a single inventory slot.
//  * - The commented-out lines suggest that the item was previously registered with a registry name, unlocalized name, and assigned to a creative tab, but these lines are currently inactive.
//  *
//  * Method: getName()
//  * - Returns the private final String 'name' of the item, which is "smallRemnants".
//  * - This method provides access to the item's name, which can be used for display purposes or further manipulation within the mod.
//  *
//  * Note: Several lines of code are commented out, indicating that they may have been used for registering the item within the game's registry and setting additional properties, but are not currently in use. This may be due to changes in the mod's structure or the Minecraft modding API.
