// /**
//  * Executive Summary:
//  * This code defines a custom item class for a Minecraft mod, named ItemStableCatalystMixture, which extends the base Item class from Minecraft's net.minecraft.item package. The purpose of this class is to create a new item within the game with specific properties and behaviors.
//  *
//  * Class: ItemStableCatalystMixture
//  * - Purpose: Represents a custom item named "stableCatalystMixture" in the game.
//  * - Extends: net.minecraft.item.Item
//  *
//  * Constructor: ItemStableCatalystMixture()
//  * - Initializes the item with a max stack size of 1.
//  * - The commented-out lines suggest that the item was previously registered with a registry name, added to the game's registry, given an unlocalized name, and assigned to a creative tab specific to the mod. These lines are currently inactive.
//  *
//  * Method: getName()
//  * - Returns the name of the item, which is "stableCatalystMixture".
//  * - This method can be used to retrieve the item's name for use in other parts of the mod, such as language files or crafting recipes.
//  *
//  * Note: The code includes several commented-out lines that indicate previous functionality for registering the item within the game's system and setting its display properties. These may need to be uncommented and updated depending on the mod's requirements and the version of Minecraft being modded.
