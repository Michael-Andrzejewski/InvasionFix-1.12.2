// /*
//  * Executive Documentation Summary
//  * 
//  * Purpose:
//  * The code defines an interface named INotifyTask within the package invmod. This interface is intended to provide a contract for implementing classes to handle notification tasks. The interface is abstract, indicating that it does not provide any concrete implementations of its methods, but rather specifies a method that implementing classes must define.
//  * 
//  * Interface Methods:
//  * - void notifyTask(int paramInt): This is an abstract method that must be implemented by any class that implements the INotifyTask interface. The method is designed to receive an integer parameter, which could be used as an identifier or a code representing the task to be notified. The specific use of the parameter is not defined within the interface, leaving it up to the implementing classes to decide how to handle the notification logic.
//  * 
//  * Usage:
//  * The INotifyTask interface is useful in scenarios where different types of notification tasks are required, and multiple classes may handle these tasks in various ways. By implementing this interface, a class agrees to provide a concrete implementation of the notifyTask method, ensuring that it can be called to perform a notification based on the provided integer parameter.
//  * 
//  * Note:
//  * Since this is an abstract interface, it cannot be instantiated directly. Classes that implement INotifyTask must provide the actual implementation details for the notifyTask method.
