//  * Executive Documentation Summary:
//  * 
//  * The IPolarAngle interface is part of the invmod.util package, which likely contains utility classes and interfaces for the Inventory Mod or a similar system. The primary purpose of this interface is to define a contract for objects that can represent or provide a polar angle. A polar angle is an angle measured in a polar coordinate system, which is typically used in mathematics and physics to specify the position of a point in a plane.
//  * 
//  * Methods:
//  * - getAngle(): This is an abstract method that must be implemented by any class that implements the IPolarAngle interface. The method is expected to return an integer value representing the polar angle. The specific unit (degrees, radians, etc.) and range (e.g., 0-360, -180 to 180) are not specified in the interface, leaving the implementation details to the implementing class. The method does not take any parameters.
//  * 
//  * Overall, the IPolarAngle interface provides a simple yet flexible way to work with polar angles within the system, ensuring that any implementing class will provide a consistent method to retrieve an angle value.
